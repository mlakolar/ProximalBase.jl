# Sets

The indicator function ``\iota_C`` of a set ``C`` is ``0`` on ``C`` and
``+\infty`` outside. Its proximal operator is the Euclidean projection
``P_C(v) = \operatorname{argmin}_{z \in C}\|z - v\|``, for every step, so
projected gradient descent is proximal gradient descent with an indicator.
[`value_and_prox!`](@ref) returns ``0``. The projections return a point within
a relative ``\sqrt{\varepsilon}`` of the set, so the result is feasible up to
rounding.

## Separable sets

The box, the nonnegative orthant and the ℓ∞ ball are products of intervals.
Their projections clamp each coordinate, and they have scalar proximal
operators for coordinate descent. A box whose bounds exclude zero does not
preserve zeros (see [`iszeropreserving`](@ref)), so on a sparse iterate it
visits every entry.

## The simplex and the ℓ1 ball

The projection onto the simplex ``\Delta_r = \{x \ge 0 : \sum_i x_i = r\}`` is
``x_i = \max(v_i - \tau, 0)``. Here ``\tau`` is the multiplier of the equality
constraint, the unique solution of

```math
\sum_i \max(v_i - \tau, 0) = r .
```

The left side is continuous, piecewise linear and decreasing in ``\tau``, so
``\tau`` lies between two sorted values of ``v``. Sorting finds it in
``O(n\log n)``. Condat's algorithm (2016) finds it in ``O(n)`` expected time
with one pass and a scratch buffer, which the function keeps. With
`equality = false` the set is ``\sum_i x_i \le r``, and ``\tau = 0`` when ``v``
already satisfies the inequality.

Projecting onto the ℓ1 ball ``\{\|x\|_1 \le r\}`` is trivial when
``\|v\|_1 \le r``. Otherwise the projection has the signs of ``v`` and solves
the simplex problem for ``|v|``. The ℓ∞ norms use this projection through
Moreau's decomposition.

## Sparsity

The projection onto ``\{x : \#\{i : x_i \ne 0\} \le s\}`` keeps the ``s``
entries of largest magnitude, a nonconvex set with an exact projection.
[`IndBallL0`](@ref) selects them with Floyd and Rivest's algorithm in ``O(n)``
expected time, in place, and in ``O(\mathrm{nnz})`` on a `SparseIterate`. It
keeps exactly ``s`` entries when there are ties. Projected gradient descent with
this set is iterative hard thresholding. On a symmetric matrix, ``s`` counts the
entries of one triangle, so that an entry and its transpose are kept or dropped
together. With `diagonal = false` the diagonal does not count and is kept, as for
the off-diagonal sparsity of a precision matrix.

## Hyperplanes and halfspaces

Minimizing ``\|z - v\|^2`` subject to ``\langle a, z\rangle = b`` gives
``z = v - \mu a`` with ``\mu = (\langle a, v\rangle - b)/\|a\|^2``. For the
halfspace ``\langle a, z\rangle \le b``, the same step applies when ``v``
violates the inequality, and ``z = v`` otherwise.

## Monotone vectors

The projection onto the nondecreasing vectors, [`IndIsotonic`](@ref), is
isotonic regression. Pool adjacent violators scans the entries, pooling each
entry with the block before it while their means are out of order. Each block
then takes its mean, the projection of the block onto the constants. With a
stack of blocks in buffers that the function owns, it runs in O(n) time.
`IndIsotonic(decreasing = true)` projects onto the nonincreasing vectors, and
the same pooling gives the proximal operator of [`SLOPE`](@ref).

## Positive semidefinite and low-rank matrices

The projection of a symmetric ``V = U\Lambda U^\top`` onto the positive
semidefinite cone, in the Frobenius norm, sets its negative eigenvalues to zero.
This holds because the Frobenius norm is unitarily invariant, and the nearest
diagonal matrix with nonnegative entries clips the negative ones.
[`IndPSD`](@ref) reads the upper triangle of its argument. It computes all the
eigenpairs with LAPACK's divide-and-conquer `syevd`, or with `rank = r` only the
``r`` largest with `syevr`, keeping the positive ones. It rebuilds the result
from the eigenvectors it keeps with one symmetric rank-``k`` update. [`IndBallRank`](@ref)`(r)` keeps the ``r`` largest singular values
of a general matrix, which by the Eckart–Young theorem gives the nearest matrix
of rank at most ``r``. Both rank sets are nonconvex with exact projections.
Projected gradient with them is hard-impute in matrix completion.
